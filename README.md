# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, unit tests were written for each part of the code to ensure that it passes all of them.
